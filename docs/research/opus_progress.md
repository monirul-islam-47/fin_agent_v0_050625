### Architecture Insights
- The system needs to handle 500+ symbols efficiently
- WebSocket connection is critical for real-time data
- Quota management must be proactive, not reactive
- UI must be responsive even during heavy processing
- Simplified 2-tier fallback is more maintainable
- Event-driven architecture enables clean separation

### Technical Considerations
- Python 3.11 for better async performance
- Streamlit's session state for WebSocket management
- JSON caching for easy debugging and inspection
- Modular design for easy testing and maintenance
- Removed complexity with IEX removal
